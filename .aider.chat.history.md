#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this file to generate the app logo.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.
